Synthesis and Exploration of Efficient Complex Systems (SEECS) is a coordinated research project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities under the Knowledge Generation Projects Call with code PID2023-147409NB-C{21-22} that will run from 2024 to 2027. The project comprises two nodes, namely UGR an UEX.

A complex system is a dynamic and intricate assembly of interconnected components or elements that, when combined, exhibit emergent behaviors and properties not explicitly inherent in the individual parts or their interactions. These systems often involve numerous interactions, dependencies, and feedback loops, making their overall behavior challenging to predict or fully understand. Complex systems are often characterized by self-organization, non-linear dynamics, and adaptability to changing environments.

The aim of this project is to create general tools to be able to explain, synthesize and improve the efficiency of such systems, as well as use them in a wide set of critical and relevant application domains. Consequently, the solutions provided will intend to augment the interpretability of complex systems, rendering it more user-friendly through the creation and dissemination of universal tools released as free software. This endeavor encompasses enhancing explainability by employing novel representation methods capable of discerning fundamental interacting components. It also involves advancing sustainability practices to improve efficiency and scale down the necessary computing power required. Lastly, it entails extracting knowledge from diverse applications of complex systems using newly developed computational intelligence tools./
